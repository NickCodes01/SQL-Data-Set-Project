These SQL reports analyze sales data to provide valuable insights into sales performance across various dimensions. Report 1 calculates key metrics such as minimum, maximum, 
and average sales quantities per customer, product, date, and state. Report 2 focuses on analyzing monthly sales trends by computing average quantities before, during, and after each month, 
excluding the year attribute to emphasize temporal patterns. These reports leverage SQL's aggregation capabilities and join operations to deliver actionable insights for optimizing sales strategies and decision-making processes.
